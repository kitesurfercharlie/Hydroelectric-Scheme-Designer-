# Hydroelectric-Scheme-Designer-
A rewrite of the matlab version.
Use this program to design your hydro scheme. All you need is a map of spot heights and an idea of what the evapotranspiration coefficients should be. Evapotranspiration is just a measure of how much water is absorded by the ground and how much is evaporated or transpired by plants. This program is based on the version made in MATLAB for the edinburgh uni interdisciplinary engineering project.
