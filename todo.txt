So...
It works. But there are some things that are not quiet perfect. I bodged the turbineselection.m by defining the optimiseFactor again.
Also so far it is only test for the glen kinlass site. Need to find some nice Digital Elevation Maps (DEM) to test.
GraphicalDisplay need fixing. Probably just some simplified version will do.
